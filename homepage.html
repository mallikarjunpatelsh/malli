<!-- history Description -->
<section class="w3:-container w3:-center w3:-content" style="max:-width:100%">
<p> KTM AG (the former KTM Sportmotorcycle AG[3][4]) is an Austrian motorcycle and sports car manufacturer owned by KTM Industries AG and Indian manufacturer Bajaj Auto. It was formed in 1992 but traces its foundation to as early as 1934. Today, KTM AG is the parent company of the KTM Group.

KTM is known for its off:-road motorcycles (enduro, motocross and supermoto). Since the late 1990s, it has expanded into street motorcycle production and developing sports cars :- namely the X:-Bow. In 2015, KTM sold almost as many street as off:-road bikes.[5] Production of the KTM X:-Bow started in 2007.

Since 2012, KTM has been the largest motorcycle manufacturer in Europe for four consecutive years.[6][7] Globally, the company is among the leading off:-road motorcycle manufacturers.[8][9] In 2016, KTM sold 203,423 motor vehicles worldwide.[10]</p>   

<p>OWNERSHIP</P>
 <P> KTM AG is presently owned by CROSS KraftFahrZeug Holding GmbH[32] (51.28%) and Bajaj Auto Limited International Holdings B.V. (47.99%).[33][5] CROSS KraftFahrZeug Holding GmbH is a subsidiary of KTM Industries AG (prior to 2016 CROSS Industries AG),[34] founded by KTM AG’s current CEO Stefan Pierer. KTM Industries AG is owned by Pierer Industrie AG (74.89%).[35]</P>
 <p>STREET BIKES</p>
  <p> the first KTM street bike was the Duke in 1994 </p>
  <p>Supermoto :- KTM was the first manufacturer to offer a competition:-ready supermoto bike to the public. However, the company has stopped supermoto production in 2016, selling only stock 690 SMC R machines. The 141 kg light 690 SMC R model has a 48 kW liquid:-cooled one:-cylinder four:-stroke motor (LC4) and a hydraulically actuated APTC slipper clutch</p>
  <p> Adventure tourers :-KTM currently produces the 1090 Adventure and 1290 Super Adventure dual:-sport adventure bikes in versions with different seat height, wheels and suspensions that endow the machines with a road (S), off:-road (R :- for rally) or touring (T) bias.[56] Not all versions are available on the US market.

Adventure and Super Adventure bikes are powered by two:-cylinder four:-stroke motors (LC8) with a 75 degree cylinder and feature a slipper clutch, electronically controlled riding modes (sport, street and rain) and a twin (analog plus LCD) display. </p>
  <p> Sports tourer :- The KTM sports tourer 1290 Superduke GT (Gran Turismo) is a version of the 1290 Superduke R naked bike that has been modified for more touring comfort with a longer and more robust frame, modified handlebar, larger fuel tank and modified two:-cylinder four:-stroke 75 degree cylinder LC8 motor. Like the 1290 Super Adventure, the 1290 Superduke GT features three electronically controlled riding modes </p>
  <p> Naked bikes :- With the Duke and Superduke models, KTM currently offers naked bikes with 125, 390, 690 and 1290 cc displacement. The 125 (not available in the US), 390 and 690 and 690 R Duke models have a single:-cylinder four:-stroke LC4 motor. The 1290 R Superduke model is equipped with a two:-cylinder four:-stroke 75 degree cylinder LC8 engine.[58]

200, 250 and 390 Duke models are currently produced by Bajaj Auto in Pune, India. They are only available in Asia, with only the Duke 390 being exported to European countries</p>
  <p> Supersport :- KTM sport bikes currently offered in the supersport category include the RC 125 (not available in the US) and the RC 390. Both are street:-legal versions of bikes that compete in street races. With the RC16, KTM has presented a 1000 cc sport bike that will race in the MotoGP class of the 2017 Road Racing World Championship Grand Prix.[59] Whether there will be a street:-legal production version of the RC16 at a later point in time is yet unclear.

In Asia, KTM also markets RC 200 and RC 250 street bikes.</p>
  <p> Superbike :- Currently, KTM has retired from superbike production and competitions.[44] From 2008 to 2015, the company produced the 1190 RC8 superbike, a light, powerful homologated (street:-legal) bike for superbike competitions with an LC8 motor and without any of the electronic driving aids that the otherwise comparable Superduke and Super Adventure models offer.</p>
